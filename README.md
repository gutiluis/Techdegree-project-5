## What I Learned:

# sqlite3 relational db file

# what is flask-sqlalchemy
    - __tablename__ is assumed with flasksqlalchemy extension within the model
    - flask sqlalchemy manages a session per request. open, add, commit or rollback, and session closed()

# what is sqlalchemy
    - db_column_model
    - imperative mapping and declarative mapping

# what is flask:
    - render_template
    - url_for:
        send-subbmit the html form. not just leave it in the browser user-agent as a post request
    - redirect
    - request:
        -proxy
        -access incoming request data after using url_for and GET and POST methods
    - app context(). create_all()
    - flask shell

# how to add users to the db manually:

# how to use jinja:
    - for loops
    - blocks
    - the child file does not have body, or head html tags
    - cannot define twice a block in the base
    - only if the child has new code the layout should have a block
    - use double quotes for html attributes
    - order of attributes does not matter. however there is a convention

# what is automatic autoescaping in jinja templates



# what is bootstrap
    - css framework with optional javascript
    - <link> tag inside the head for css
    - <scrip></script> tag for javascript
    - use bootstrap in head and body before closing the body
    - bundle: modals, dropdowns, collapse, tooltips, popovers, carousel
    - subresource integrity (SRI)
    - bootstrap.css classes
    - bootstap.js
    - removed crossorigin and integrity hash


# css
    - At-rules
        - keyframes
        - mediaqueries

# custom error pages in flask

# html:
    - the same name of the form attribute should be used with sqlalchemy when creating the model object instance
