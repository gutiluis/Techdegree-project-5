## What I Learned:

# SQLite relational db file

# what is flask-sqlalchemy
    - __tablename__ is assumed with flasksqlalchemy extension within the model
    - flask sqlalchemy manages a session per request. open, add, commit or rollback, and session closed()

# what is sqlalchemy
    - db_column_model
    - imperative mapping and declarative mapping

# what is flask:
    - render_template
    - url_for:
        - send-subbmit the html form. not just leave it in the browser user-agent as a post request
        - used to implement an internal flask route function
    - redirect
    - request:
        -proxy
        -access incoming request data after using url_for and GET and POST methods
    - app context(). create_all()
    - flask shell

# how to add users to the db manually:

# how to use jinja:
    - for loops
    - blocks
    - the child file does not have body, or head html tags
    - cannot define twice a block in the base
    - only if the child has new code the layout should have a block
    - use double quotes for html attributes
    - order of attributes does not matter. however there is a convention

# what is automatic autoescaping in jinja templates



# what is bootstrap
    - css framework with optional javascript
    - <link> tag inside the head for css
    - <scrip></script> tag for javascript
    - use bootstrap in head and body before closing the body
    - bundle: modals, dropdowns, collapse, tooltips, popovers, carousel
    - subresource integrity (SRI)
    - bootstrap.css classes
    - bootstap.js
    - removed crossorigin and integrity hash


# CSS
    - At-rules
        - keyframes
        - mediaqueries

# custom error pages in flask

# html:
    - the same name of the form attribute should be used with sqlalchemy when creating the model object instance
    - within the form the required attribute does not affect the nullable=false within the sqlalchemy model

# http:
    - 302 found request post, 200, 304
    - cache
    - GET, POST
    - URI

# how to use sqlite3 CLI:
    - sqlite3 db_file.db
    - .tables
    - select * from table_name;
    - .schema table_name;
    - PRAGMA table_info(projects);
    
    # update sqlitedb with or without transactions
    - UPDATE project
    - SET id = '2'
    - WHERE id = 1;


    # safer to do a transaction directly sqlite3 in db form cli
    BEGIN;

    UPDATE projects
    SET github_repo = 'https://github.com/gutiluis/Techdegree-project-5'
    WHERE id = 1;
    # check
    SELECT id, github_repo FROM projects WHERE id = 1;

    COMMIT;


    # use not null to force the column always have input

# aplying an href to an anchor changes the font. the goal is using an url_for flask route


# difference between string parse time and string parse format time
model needs a datetime object. strptime

# get appearse in the browser. post doesnt

# using strftime within jinja template to display only year and month


# value does not work with jinja from the form in textarea tags
In HTML, the initial content of a <textarea> is specified between its opening and closing tags, not as a value attribute.

# flask error handling not for normal control flow
# not to replace validation
# not to hide bugs permanently
# error handling in flask is for exceptions

# request in flask
class flask.Request(environ, populate_request=True, shallow=False)¶
property form: ImmutableMultiDict[str, str]
The form parameters. By default an ImmutableMultiDict is returned from this function. This can be changed by setting parameter_storage_class to a different type. This might be necessary if the order of the form data is important.

# get_or_404(ident(Any), description=None)
Like get() but aborts with a 404 Not Found error instead of returning None.
